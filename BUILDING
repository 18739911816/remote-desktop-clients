1. Install sqlitegen plugin into Eclipse from:

    http://code.google.com/p/sqlitegen/

2. Add bVNC, ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and ssh2 from the 
    eclipse_projects/ directory to Eclipse as Android projects

3. Add the ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and ssh2 projects
   as Library References to bVNC (right-click on the bVNC project
   -> Properties -> Android -> Library).

4. Add the ssh2 project as a Library Reference to PubkeyGenerator.

   Alternatively, you may take the jar file built in ssh2's bin/
   directory and add it to the libs/ directory of bVNC and
   PubkeyGenerator rather than adding it as a reference.
