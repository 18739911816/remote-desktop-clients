0. On Linux, install Eclipse Neon for Android Developers and ADT Plugin.
   a) Point Eclipse at a valid Android SDK installation location.
   b) Install ADT Plugin:
      Help > Install New Software.
      Click Add, in the top-right corner.
      In the Add Repository dialog, name it ADT Plugin and specify location to be
        https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/

1. Install sqlitegen into Eclipse.

   a) Download sqlitegen plugin v0.1.19 from:
      https://github.com/iiordanov/sqlitegen-secure/releases/download/v0.1.19/sqlitegen_eclipse_site_0.1.19.jar

      NOTE: Using an older version of the plugin may not work because
      of the switch to the sqlcipher release of sqlite.

   b) Help -> Install New Software
   c) Add -> Archive
   d) Browse to the downloaded jar file and select it.
   e) Give it a name and click OK
   f) Select "Uncategorized"
   g) Click Next and follow the installation process.
   h) Restart Eclipse.

2. Add AppCompat v7 project into Eclipse
   - Eclipse->Import->Existing Android Code Into Workspace.
   - The AppCompat project is found here:
       /path/to/android-sdk/extras/android/support/v7/appcompat/
   - You may have to switch the Android Build Target to API 23 or newer
     by (Right-clicking on the project)->Properties->Android

3. Install at least the following dependencies:
   cmake automake libtool intltool gtk-doc-tools gnome-common

4. Change directory to the Opaque project
   cd eclipse_projects/Opaque/jni/libs/
   ./build-deps.sh -j 4 -n /path/to/your/ndk build

5. Import all projects into Eclipse.

   Add bVNC, ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator from the
   bVNC/eclipse_projects/ directory to Eclipse as existing Android
   projects.
  
   The FreeRDP project was downloaded automatically as part of the build process,
   and a symlinc was made to it in bVNC/eclipse_projects/

   Some modifications are needed to the freeRDPCore project in part because
   it is set up to be developed under the ADT IDE.

   - Import eclipse_projects/FreeRDP/client/Android/Studio/freeRDPCore
     into Eclipse as "Existing Android Code". Name the project FreeRDPCore
     by clicking "New Project Name" before clicking "Finish".

   - In the Project Properties, change Project Build Target to Android 7.0+

   - Also there, make sure Android->Is Library checkbox is checked.

   - Also there, click Add to a reference to the AppCompat project (from 2)

   - Also there, change Java Compiler->Compiler compliance level to 1.7.

   - Clean and rebuild the project.

6. Ensure ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, FreeRDPCore, and android-support-v7-appcompat
   projects are:
   - Called exactly as written here by right-clicking on each of them,
     then selecting Refactor->Rename

   - Added as as Library References to bVNC (right-click on the bVNC project
     and select Properties -> Android -> Library). If they are not - add them.

   - Are specified as "Required projects on the build path" (right-
     click on the bVNC project, and select Properties -> Java Build
     Path -> Projects). If they are not, add them.

   - Are referenced in Properties -> Project References (put checkmarks on projects).

7a. To build bVNC, just use the IDE to deploy the project to your device, etc.

7b. To build aSPICE, you need to:
   - Unpack gstreamer-sdk 1.4.5 into /opt/gstreamer. I obtained my copy from:
     https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/pkg/android/1.4.5/gstreamer-1.0-android-arm-release-1.4.5.tar.bz2
     Newer versions either crash or have GNUtls errors that need work.

   - Edit AndroidManifest.xml and change android:label="bVNC" and android:name="bVNC"
     to android:label="aSPICE" and android:name="aSPICE" respectively.

   - cd bVNC/eclipse_projects/bVNC

   - Replace all instances of aSPICE with bVNC in native code (.c and .h files).
     This requirement should go away in the future. You can use the following command:
       find jni/src -name \*.h -o -name \*.c -exec sed -i 's/aSPICE/bVNC/' {} \;

   - ndk-build -j 12

   - Unfortunately, currently ndk-build destroys other pre-existing libraries in eclipse_projects/bVNC/libs,
     so after successfully building libspice and libgstreamer, one has to git checkout the files which were deleted.

   - Force one boolean variable to be true. You can use the following command:
       find ./ -name \*.java -exec sed -i 's/isSpice = .*;/isSpice = true;/' {} \;

   - You may have to select the "Android private libraries" entry in
       Project Properties->Java Build Path->Order and Export
     if you have it.

   - Enable requesting the RECORD_AUDIO permission in AndroidManifest.xml with the following sed command:
     sed -i 's/<!--RECORD_AUDIO-->/<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO"><\/uses-permission>/g' AndroidManifest.xml

7c. To build aRDP, you have to successfully build the FreeRDP library.
   - Edit AndroidManifest.xml and change android:label="bVNC" and android:name="bVNC"
     to android:label="aRDP" and android:name="aRDP" respectively.

Please inform me if (6) needs to be expanded (i.e. if you needed to do anything else in addition to the above.
