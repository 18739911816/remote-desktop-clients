2. Add AppCompat v7 project into Eclipse
   - Eclipse->Import->Existing Android Code Into Workspace.
   - The AppCompat project is found here:
       /path/to/android-sdk/extras/android/support/v7/appcompat/
   - You may have to switch the Android Build Target to API 23 or newer
     by (Right-clicking on the project)->Properties->Android

3. Import all projects into Eclipse.
   Add bVNC, ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, android-support-v7-appcompat,
   and FreeRDPCore projects.

   The bVNC, ZoomerWithKeys, and PubkeyGenerator are in the
   bVNC/eclipse_projects/ directory. Add them to Eclipse as existing Android
   projects.

   The android-support-v7-appcompat project is available under the
   extras/android/support/v7/appcompat/ in your Android SDK if you have
   installed the support libraries through the SDK manager.

   The FreeRDP project was downloaded automatically as part of the build process,
   and a symlinc was made to it in bVNC/eclipse_projects/.

   Some modifications are needed to the freeRDPCore project in part because
   it is set up to be developed under the ADT IDE.

   - Import eclipse_projects/FreeRDP/client/Android/Studio/freeRDPCore
     into Eclipse as "Existing Android Code". Name the project FreeRDPCore
     by clicking "New Project Name" before clicking "Finish".

   - In the Project Properties, change Project Build Target to Android 7.0+

   - Also there, make sure Android->Is Library checkbox is checked.

   - Also there, click Add to a reference to the AppCompat project (from 2)

   - Also there, change Java Compiler -> Enable project specific settings -> 
     Compiler compliance level to 1.7.

   - Clean and rebuild the project.

4. Ensure ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, FreeRDPCore, and android-support-v7-appcompat
   projects are:
   - Called exactly as written here by right-clicking on each of them,
     then selecting Refactor->Rename

   - Added as as Library References to bVNC (right-click on the bVNC project
     and select Properties -> Android -> Library). If they are not - add them.

   - Are specified as "Required projects on the build path" (right-
     click on the bVNC project, and select Properties -> Java Build
     Path -> Projects). If they are not, add them.

   - Are referenced in Properties -> Project References (put checkmarks on projects).

5. Install at least the following dependencies on your Linux machine:
   cmake automake libtool intltool gtk-doc-tools gnome-common gobject-introspection nasm
