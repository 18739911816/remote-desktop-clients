1. Install sqlitegen plugin into Eclipse from:

    http://code.google.com/p/sqlitegen/

2. Add bVNC, ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and ssh2 from the 
    eclipse_projects/ directory to Eclipse as Android projects

3. Either:
   a) Add the ZoomerWithKeys, PubkeyGenerator, and ssh2 projects
   as Library References to bVNC (right-click on the bVNC project
   -> Properties -> Android -> Library), or
   b) take the jar files from each of the the projects generated
   in their bin/ directories and add them to the libs/ directory
   of bVNC.
