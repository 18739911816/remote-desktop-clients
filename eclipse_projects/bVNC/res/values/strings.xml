bVNC automatically saves sessions. Once connected, you can choose between Zoomable, Fit to Screen, and One to One scaling. 
bVNC also supports two Input Modes, Touch Mouse and Simulated Touchpad. To change the Scaling or Input Mode, or get Help,
swipe down from beyond top edge to access the Menu. For help with Input Modes (i.e. how to control the remote mouse),
select Menu->More->Input Mode Help. Please note that full-screen mode in Android Player must be enabled in order to
see the Zoom controls at the bottom of the screen.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Other Menu items include toggling Ctrl/Alt, various shortcuts to keys, and sending arbitrary text and key
combinations.</string>

"Please note that full-screen mode in Android Player must be enabled in order to see the Zoom controls at the bottom of the screen.

In any Input Mode, swipe up diagonally from the bottom left corner or press the keyboard icon between the Zoom controls to get the on-screen keyboard.

Use Touch Mouse and Swipe Pan Mode for more intuitive touch-screen control. Use Simulated Touchpad Mode for finer control over the mouse.

Touch Mouse and Swipe Pan Mode:
 - Control the mouse directly through touch.
 - Swipe to pan around.
 - Tapping makes the mouse click where you tapped.
 
Simulated Touchpad Mode:
 - Use your screen like a touchpad.
 - Swipe to move the mouse pointer around.
 - Move mouse beyond edge of screen to pan.
 - Tapping makes the mouse click where the pointer is.

All Input Modes:
 - Tap once to left-click.
 - Double-tap to double-click.
 - Tap-hold and tap with a second finger to right-click.
 - Tap-hold and tap with two more fingers to middle-click.
 - Tap-hold-long and swipe to drag.
 - When in Zoomable scaling, you can pinch-zoom or use the +/- Zoom buttons.
 - Use the \"Back\" functionality of your device for ESC (diagonal swipe from bottom or back arrow symbol)."

   "When you first start bVNC, you will see a connection configuration page. Here you can set up a new VNC connection, or choose a preexisting one. The page is divided into two sections. The top section contains a drop-down list of the connection configurations you've created previously. The first time your run bVNC, you will only be able to make a new connection. Next to the list is a Connect button. The Connect button will start the VNC client with the currently selected configuration. Below that is where you enter your connection configurations. There are more options than will fit on the page, so scroll down through this section.

 - Nickname: Each configuration you create can have a nickname to easily identify it on the list.

 - Password: If your VNC server configuration requires a password, enter that password here. Secure storage is not used for passwords, and the password will be stored only if you check the "Keep" box. The password will be filled in on this page if you haven't quit bVNC since you last entered it.

 - Address: This is where you enter the host name or IP address of the computer running the VNC server that you wish to contact.

 - Port: This is the port number of the VNC server. This field will be 5900 by default, which is the first VNC port. 

 - Color Format: The client supports several color formats. Formats with more bits per pixel provide a better visual experience at the expense of greater bandwidth and more CPU on your device. Some VNC servers do not support all color depths (e.g. OS/X Remote Desktop requires 24-bit color). If you are having trouble connecting, try another color depth. 

 - Use local mouse pointer: Some VNC servers (e.g. OS/X Remote Desktop) will not draw the mouse pointer on the client. Checking this option will cause bVNC to draw a small square at the mouse position. 

 - Force full-screen bitmap: The VNC client uses a bitmap to represent the remote display. For very large remote displays, especially in fit-to-screen mode, you may experience strange visual artifacts when in fit-to-screen mode, due to per-process memory limitations. If that happens, try checking this option. Keep in mind that checking the option may cause bVNC to quit on connection.

 - Repeater: If you use a UltraVNC repeater to connect to your VNC server, enter its address and port separated by colons in this field."</string>
