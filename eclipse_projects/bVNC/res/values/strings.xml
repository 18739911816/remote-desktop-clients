bVNC now supports tunneling VNC over SSH for enterprise-level security. It also supports UltraVNC with Windows Logon.
Sessions are automatically saved. Once connected, you can choose between Zoomable, Fit to Screen,
and One to One scaling, as well as between Touch Mouse and Simulated Touchpad input modes. Use the Menu to: 
delete connections on the main screen, change the Scaling or Input Mode when connected, or get Help.
In addition, you can toggle Ctrl/Alt, use the arrow keys, and send arbitrary text and key combinations.
Input Mode Help (how to control the remote mouse) is available at Menu->More->Input Mode Help.
&lt;br&gt;
* WARNING: Beware that using a hardware Trackpad/ball triggers a bug in Android which prevents bVNC from
resizing the visible screen when the soft-keyboard is up (and it starts to cover part of the screen). Using
a software D-pad, or soft-keyboard arrow keys causes no problems. Note that bVNC now has the option to
use D-pad or Trackpad/ball to send arrow keys instead of moving the mouse pointer.

"Please note that in order to see the Keyboard button at the bottom of the screen, you must be in full-screen mode (i.e. the system must not be hiding the bottom of the screen).

In any Input Mode, tap the keyboard icon to get the on-screen keyboard. On some devices you can swipe up diagonally from the bottom left corner (Playbook).

Use Touch Mouse and Swipe Pan Mode for more intuitive touch-screen control. Use Simulated Touchpad Mode for finer control over the mouse.

Touch Mouse and Swipe Pan Mode:
 - Control the mouse directly through touch.
 - Swipe to pan around.
 - Tapping makes the mouse click where you tapped.
 - Scroll events are sent between the two fingers where a two-finger swipe started.
 
Simulated Touchpad Mode:
 - Use your screen like a touchpad.
 - Swipe to move the mouse pointer around.
 - Move mouse beyond edge of screen to pan.
 - Tapping makes the mouse click where the pointer is.
 - Scroll events are sent where the mouse pointer is located.

All Input Modes:
 - Left-click: Tap once.
 - Double-click: Double-tap.
 - Right-click: Tap-hold and tap with a second finger (anywhere else on screen).
 - Middle-click: Tap-hold and tap with two more fingers (anywhere else on screen).
 - Mouse-drag: Tap-hold-long and swipe.
 - Scroll-wheel: Two-finger swipe up/down. Swipe quickly (flick) to scroll really quickly.
 - Zoom in/out: When in Zoomable scaling, you can pinch-zoom to control scaling.
 - ESC key: Use the \"Back\" functionality of your device (e.g. diagonal swipe from bottom or back arrow symbol).
 - Ctrl/Alt key: Menu, and then toggle Ctrl/Alt with corresponding key. Don't forget to toggle off when done!
 - Key combos: Menu->More->Send Keys.
 - Send text: Either type on the on-screen keyboard, or use Menu->More->Send Text."

"When you first start bVNC, you will see a connection configuration page. Here you can set up a new VNC connection, or choose a preexisting one. The page is divided into two sections. The top section contains a drop-down list of the connection configurations you've created previously. The first time your run bVNC, you will only be able to make a new connection. Next to the list is a Connect button. The Connect button will start the VNC client with the currently selected configuration. Below that is where you configure your connection.

If you are looking for a quick performance boost, try setting the Color mode to a lower value. Also, try removing any desktop background image on the VNC server. Finally, ensure your device has good network connectivity and avoid covering its antenna and reducing the signal strength.

 - Nickname: Each configuration you create can have a nickname to easily identify it on the list.
 
 - SSH Server/Port: Available in VNC over SSH mode, this is the address and port of the SSH server that the connection will be tunnelled through. By default SSH listens on port 22.
 
 - SSH Auth.: Available in VNC over SSH mode, these are the username and password of the account on the SSH server. The password will be filled in on this page if you haven't quit bVNC since you last entered it.

 - VNC Server/Port: This is where you enter the host name or IP address and port of the computer running the VNC server that you wish to contact. In VNC over SSH mode, this address is as seen from the SSH Server. If the SSH Server and VNC server are the same computer, you can use localhost. VNC servers typically listen starting at port 5900 (the first VNC screen, screen :0).

 - VNC User: Available in UltraVNC with Windows Logon mode, this is where you enter your Windows username.

 - VNC Auth.: If your VNC server configuration requires a password, enter that password here. In UltraVNC with Windows Logon mode, put your Windows account password here. Secure storage is not used for passwords, and the password will be stored only if you check the "Keep" box. The password will be filled in on this page if you haven't quit bVNC since you last entered it.

 - Color Mode: The client supports several color modes. Modes with more colors provide a better visual experience at the expense of greater bandwidth and more CPU computation on your device. Some VNC servers do not support all color depths (e.g. OS/X Remote Desktop requires 24-bit color). If you are having trouble connecting, try another color depth.

 - Use D-Pad for arrows: If you prefer, you can use the D-Pad of your Bluetooth keyboard or arrows on your on-screen keyboard to send arrows to the VNC server.

 - Rotate D-Pad: Phones paired with a Bluetooth keyboard may need the keyboard's D-pad to be rotated anti-clockwise to send correct directions to the server.
 
 - Switch to portrait: If you prefer portrait mode (one handed use, or more vertical space with soft-keyboard), check this box to switch to portrait mode when connected. Main screen will stay in landscape mode.

 - Local mouse pointer: Some VNC servers (e.g. OS/X Remote Desktop) will not draw the mouse pointer on the client. Checking this option will cause bVNC to draw a small square at the mouse position. 

 - Force full-screen bitmap: The VNC client uses a bitmap to represent the remote display. For very large remote displays, especially in fit-to-screen mode, you may experience strange visual artifacts when in fit-to-screen mode, due to per-process memory limitations. If that happens, try checking this option. Keep in mind that checking the option may cause bVNC to quit on connection.

 - Repeater: Available in UltraVNC mode, if you use a repeater to connect to your VNC server, enter its address and port separated by a colon in this field."</string>
